16/4:
Installed nagios3:
sudo apt-get install nagios3
Still have to play aound with the config files...

26/4:
Got nagios to monitor on the db server (fixing a problem where it wasn't
accessible from root@192.168...., as described in:
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/allow-mysql-client-connection/
Most of this was just following Tom's notes from class.

27/4:
Installed Nagios NRPE plugin:
sudo apt-get install nagios-nrpe-plugin
- this is for monitoring remote services on other servers.
Added:
define host{
  use   generic-host
  host_name     groupa-db
  alias         db
  address       192.168.2.102
}

define service{
  use   generic-service
  host_name     groupa-db
  service_description Disk Space
  check_command check_nrpe_1arg!check_disk
}
to conf.d/db_host.cfg to define the db host and remote service "Disk Space"
and restarted nagios.

28/4:
Installed NSClient++ on group-ad (our windows server)
Configured nagios to monitor the client via the check_nt plugin. This is 
described at :
http://awaseroot.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/monitoring-windows-with-nagios/
- copied windows.cfg from /usr/share/... to /etc/nagios3/objects
and modified appropriately. Also added templates.cfg in the same place (as
described in the link) which defines the windows-server host type.
Also changed command in nt.cfg to:
define command {
  command_name check_nt
  command_line /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nt -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -s YOUR_PASSWORD -v $ARG1$ $ARG2$
}
and modified nagios.cfg by uncommenting the lines:
cfg_file=/etc/nagios3/objects/templates.cfg
cfg_file=/etc/nagios3/objects/windows.cfg
Commented out most of the other services and just left the check_version one
running.

7/5:
Reconfigured email to work with nagios:
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
- did this. However, nagios still doesn't seem to be sending out emails!?
Also enabled external commands (from the web interface) in nagios, as 
described in:
http://www.ghacks.net/2010/04/05/nagios-enable-external-commands/

Bacula:
9/4/13: Installed bacula client and server:
apt-get install bacula-server
apt-get install bacula-client
and changed config files:
/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf: FileStorage->/home/bacula/storage
/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf: RestoreFiles->/home/bacula/storage
/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf: FileSet->/home/bacula/data_to_backup
and restart director and client:
/etc/init.d/bacula-director reload
/etc/init.d/bacula-sd restart
Then enter bconsole. Type 'label' -> menu: pick 'File' option and enter name of storage volume. Finally, type 'run' in bconsole to start the backup.
To restore files type 'restore all' in bconsole -> pick option 5. Then bacula
asks which files to restore enter 'done' to restore everything.
Note that bacula has 3 daemons: director, file daemon, and storage daemon. Only
the
file daemon bacula-fd, along with its config file bacula-fd.conf, need to be on
machines to be backed up.

13/4/13:
Played around with the bacula conf files to get the backup working on the
db server. Note
1. Test connections between servers with telnet, e.g.
telnet 198.169.2.101 9102
etc.
2. Comment out refernces to DirAddress=..., FDAddress=..., SDAddress=...
in the conf files. These are optional and give which ip the fd/sd/dir listen
to, i.e. without these fields the daemon will accept connections from any ip.
3. Make sure the name and passwords are the same in dir and fd conf files.

18/4:
Configured the bacula-dir to work with the group-ad-fd client. Haven't checked
the restore yet. Checked the restore and works fine! Note that we had quite a 
bit of trouble getting the fd service running on the windows server - didn't
appear as a process. In the end we reinstalled and it worked fine.

25/4:
Fixed problem with bacula's backup of MyCatalog. Didn't notice this error
before - it appeared some time when I was configuring the db/ad servers. This 
error is described at:
http://www.mail-archive.com/bacula-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39535.html
- essentially changed ownership of dbcheck and bacula-dir.conf as instructed
and now seems to work fine. I'm not even sure when and hopw this problem
started, because the catalog seemed to backup initially ok.

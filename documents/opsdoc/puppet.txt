14/5:
Installed puppetmaster on this server:
sudo apt-get install puppetmaster
Changed the file /etc/puppet/puppet.conf by adding the lines:
[master]
certname=mgmt.groupi.sqrawler.com
and then restarted the puppetmaster as per instructions. Rob installed the
client on the db server. Had some problems initially with the certificates
by using commands like:
sudo puppetca --clean {client=groupa-db}
sudo puppetca -s groupa-db
etc.

9/4/13:
Installed bacula client and server:
apt-get install bacula-server
apt-get install bacula-client
and changed config files:
/etc/bacula/bacula-sd.conf: FileStorage->/home/bacula/storage
/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf: RestoreFiles->/home/bacula/storage
/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf: FileSet->/home/bacula/data_to_backup
and restart director and client:
/etc/init.d/bacula-director reload
/etc/init.d/bacula-sd restart
Then enter bconsole. Type 'label' -> menu: pick 'File' option and enter name of storage volume. Finally, type 'run' in bconsole to start the backup.
To restore files type 'restore all' in bconsole -> pick option 5. Then bacula 
asks which files to restore enter 'done' to restore everything.
Note that bacula has 3 daemons: director, file daemon, and storage daemon. Only
the
file daemon bacula-fd, along with its config file bacula-fd.conf, need to be on
machines to be backed up.

11/4/13:
Installed sudo
Added users hegargm1 and attfire1 and made sudoers

12/4/13:
Added user tclark and made sudoer

13/4/13:
Played around with the bacula conf files to get the backup working on the
db server. Note
1. Test connections between servers with telnet, e.g.
telnet 198.169.2.101 9102
etc.
2. Comment out refernces to DirAddress=..., FDAddress=..., SDAddress=...
in the conf files. These are optional and give which ip the fd/sd/dir listen
to, i.e. without these fields the daemon will accept connections from any ip.
3. Make sure the name and passwords are the same in dir and fd conf files.

16/4:
Installed nagios3:
sudo apt-get install nagios3
Still have to play aound with the config files...

17/4:
Got the group-ad-fd working on the windows server. Have to configure this server
so that it will do a backup.

18/4:
Configured the bacula-dir to work with the group-ad-fd client. Haven't checked 
the restore yet.

25/4:
Fixed problem with bacula's backup of MyCatalog. This error is 
described at:
http://www.mail-archive.com/bacula-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39535.html
- essentially changed ownership of dbcheck and bacula-dir.conf as instructed
and now seems to work fine. I'm not even sure when and hopw this problem 
started, because the catalog seemed to backup initially ok.

26/4:
Got nagios to monitor on the db server (fixing a problem where it wasn't
accessible from root@192.168...., as described in:
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/allow-mysql-client-connection/

27/4:
Installed Nagios NRPE plugin:
sudo apt-get install nagios-nrpe-plugin
- this is for monitoring remote services on other servers.

28/4:
Installed NSClient++ on group-ad (windows) server and configured Nagios on this
machine to monitor services on it.

29/4:
Wrote the opsdoc for nagios in opsdoc/nagios.txt (Also put the bacula one
in the same directory).

30/4:
Played around with the config of bacula again
1. Got DB backing up to the storage server (also checked restore)
- the following bit of the manual is useful for this:
http://www.bacula.org/en/dev-manual/main/main/Basic_Volume_Management.html
2. Playing around with the mysqldump. Haven't got it working yet, but problem
is described at:
http://www.ctrl-alt-del.cc/2008/08/backing-up-mysql-with-daily-snapshots-and-bacula.html
and
http://wiki.bacula.org/doku.php?id=application_specific_backups:mysql
I'll have another go at this (and getting the rest of things backed up properly
tomorrow.

7/5:
First class back. Tom went over a few nagios things in class. The first was
how to schedule regular jobs with the "cron" command (and one-off jobs with
the "at" command).
Also showed us a way to fix email (wasn't configured correctly), i.e.
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
- did this. However, nagios still doesn't seem to be sending out emails!?
Also enabled external commands in nagios, as described in:
http://www.ghacks.net/2010/04/05/nagios-enable-external-commands/

10/5:
Configured bacula to backup all jobs to the storage server. Need to check this
over the weekend to make sure it runs ok. Also need to make sure all the 
necessary files are backed up (check with Tom for a comprehensive list). 
Also modified nagios config so that it now notifies my local email on this
server (apparently Tom's going to set up a relay to stop it being blocked
by spam filters - because it comes from nagios@debian.local).
Installed git on this (mgmt) server and initialized ~/coderepo

11/5:
Updated nagios config so that it now monitors the storage server as well.
Also added linux servers to the Debian/Linux hostgroup - now the icons
appear in the web front-end (including the windows one).
Added db and storage servers to the ssh-servers and debian-servers groups.

14/5:
Installed ntp and ntpdate to correct the time
apt-get install ntp
apt-get install ntpdate
Updated /etc/hosts to include hosts on the local network and copied the same
to the db hosts file
Installed puppetmaster on this server:
sudo apt-get install puppetmaster
Changed the file /etc/puppet/puppet.conf by adding the lines:
[master]
certname=mgmt.groupi.sqrawler.com
and then restarted the puppetmaster as per instructions. Rob installed the 
client on the db server. Had some problems initially with the certificates
by using commands like:
sudo puppetca --clean {client=groupa-db}
sudo puppetca -s groupa-db
etc.

15/5:
I've been looking at password manager/safe programs today. I tried:
keepassx
keysafe
pwsafe
on our mgmt server. I removed the first 2 as they require a GUI. pwsafe seems 
a simple way to go and it's got good help. Found some good tips at:
http://www.debian-administration.org/users/yaarg/weblog/3
I installed this:
sudo apt-get install pwsafe
The other option is to store passwords in a text file and encrypt with gnupg, 
or something like that.
